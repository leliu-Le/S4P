  <p>Before we begin, I'd like to invite you to participate in creating this booklet. The interviewer, language, and distribution format will all be decided based on our discussion today. As someone directly involved, you'll have a clearer understanding of what approach would be safer. What format do you think would be most suitable for this booklet?</p> <br>Well, let me explain the current situation with the school and my circumstances, and what the outcome has been so far. Since this incident began, I've been summoned for talks seven times. The first six times were with my administrative teacher and the Party Secretary of our college—they took turns meeting with me six times. The final time, representatives from the Provincial Education Bureau and the police station came to see me. This last one felt more serious—it had a threatening tone. Their purpose for summoning me was because someone from another province had reported the incident. This led the Guangdong provincial government to question why the Education Bureau couldn't handle this properly, allowing such a scandal to spread outside the province. In other words, society at large isn't demanding action against this teacher. The implication was to focus on resolving the student's situation. That's the current state of affairs—things have calmed down now. They mentioned via WeChat that if this issue resurfaces, it won't just be me facing consequences; others present would face harsher penalties. I'm not sure if this was just verbal or what, but that's what they told me. I've also discussed this with the document's initiator and other participants. The classmate who started the document is in an even worse position because she's from the School of Journalism and Communication, where they might be more strict about managing public opinion. They told her they would revoke all her eligibility for awards and honors. Their interrogation of her was also more inhumane. They kept treating her like a mentally ill person. They made her wear a coat—according to her description, it was extremely heavy, and she suspected it might contain a listening device. They told her it belonged to a teacher, forcing her to put it on and take it off repeatedly, then demanding she take it back to her dormitory. She has now thrown that coat into the freezer. And, well... I feel like, on their end, I'm really unsure if they'd still be willing to accept this interview, because honestly, I think it's had a huge impact on them. She herself is an outstanding student who was absolutely guaranteed a spot in the graduate program. This incident might have cost her that opportunity. Anyway, I think it's had a very negative effect on her. Well, that's pretty much the situation here. The police department told me they'll issue an announcement later. They also said the students who first posted this incident and shared the documents might not be able to graduate. But I think that's utterly ridiculous—if this incident prevents you from graduating.
